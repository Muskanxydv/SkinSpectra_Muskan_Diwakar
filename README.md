Description:
SkinSpectra is a web-based application that helps users identify their exact skin tone by uploading a photo and selecting a specific area of their skin. Based on this   selection, it analyzes the skin tone using RGB values and recommends personalized color palettes that complement the userâ€™s complexion. The goal is to make it easier for people to choose clothing and accessories that enhance their natural look and boost confidence.
